# IX Drone Showcase

Welcome to the IX Drone Showcase repository. This project demonstrates the conceptual and architectural design of the IX-powered drone platform designed for space-capable autonomous UAV operations.

## Overview

- Showcase of modular drone design using the IX programming language.
- Focus on advanced energy harvesting, autonomy, and VR-assisted control.
- Includes detailed schematics, firmware stubs, and sensor integration examples.

## Project Goals

- Provide a fully open, transparent architecture for community review.
- Highlight the capabilities and design philosophy of the IX ecosystem.
- Serve as a base for further development and collaborative innovation.

## Repository Structure

- `/hardware` – KiCad schematics, PCB layouts, BOMs.
- `/firmware` – PlatformIO projects, drone control code samples.
- `/docs` – Documentation, design rationale, user manuals.
- `/simulations` – Simulation models and test scripts.
- `/resources` – Datasheets, images, and reference materials.
